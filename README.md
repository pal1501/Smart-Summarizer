# Smart-Summarizer
As part of my Generative AI project, I developed a Smart Meeting Notes Summarizer to address the challenge of manually capturing important points during meetings. I noticed that note-taking is often time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error â€” which led me to explore automation using Generative AI.

In this project, I combined Whisper (for audio transcription) and Gemini API (for text summarization) to create a system that converts raw meeting recordings into clear, structured summaries. Users can upload an audio file or transcript, and the system extracts key decisions, discussions, and action items automatically.

To make the solution accessible and easy to use, I built a web interface using Streamlit on VS Code in Windows. This hands-on experience helped me understand the practical integration of generative models in real-world productivity tools and deepened my understanding of NLP, transcription, and summarization.
